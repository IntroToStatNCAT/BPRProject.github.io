## MATH Course Content-Knowledge Assessments

* College Algebra I (MATH 103): Diagnostic assessment that is used as the final departmental exam for the course at NCA&T. This is not a validated instrument. The validation of this instrument will take place part of the current BPR LSI project.

* College Algebra II (MATH 104): Diagnostic assessment that is used as the final departmental exam for the course at NCA&T. This is not a validated instrument. The validation of this instrument will take place part of the current BPR LSI project.


* Calculus I (MATH 131): Uses the Calculus Concepts Inventory of Epstein [Epstein, J. (2013). The Calculus Concept Inventory—Measurement of the Effect of Teaching Methodology in Mathematics. _Notices of the AMS_, 60(8):1018-1026.], which is a validated instrument. The test assesses content knowledge of functions, derivatives, limits, ratios, and the continuum. The instrument can be accessed through the [PhysPort](https://www.physport.org/assessments/assessment.cfm?A=CCI){:target="_blank"} project.

* Calculus II (MATH 132): Diagnostic assessment created for a previously implemented BPR study. This is not a validated instrument. The validation of this instrument will take place part of the current BPR LSI project.

* Introduction to Probability & Statistics (MATH 224): Uses the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in a First Statistics Course (CAOS) test originally developed by del Mas et al. [del Mas, R., Garfield, J., Ooms, A., and Chance, B. (2007), “Assessing Students’ Conceptual Understanding After a First Course in Statistics,”
*Statistics Education Research Journal*, 6:28–58.] and modified by Chance et al. [Chance, B., Wong, J., and Tintle, N. (2016), “Student Performance in Curricula Centered on Simulation-Based Inference: A Preliminary Report,” *Journal of Statistics Education*, 24(3):114-126.]. The instrument was generously shared by Professor Nathan Tintle. 

**Instructors wanting to use any of the above assessments in their courses can request a copy from test developers directly or from the project team by emailing PI Sayed Mostafa at _sabdelmegeed@ncat.edu_**.
