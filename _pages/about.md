Project Goals
======

Students' learning strategies are thoughts, behaviors, or beliefs that facilitate the acquisition, understanding, or transfer of new knowledge and skills. Learning strategies range from being as basic as re-reading the material to being as complex as synthesizing knowledge. In this Broadening Participation Research (BPR) Project, we propose to examine the effectiveness of integrating learning-strategy instruction within five gate-keeper math courses (MATH103-College Algebra I; MATH104-College Algebra II; MATH131-Calculus I; MATH132-Calculus II; MATH224-Intro to probability & Statistics) in fostering math growth mindset and self-regulated learning (SRL) in underrepresented minority (URM) students and improving students' performance in these courses. The project explores and employs innovative ways to seamlessly integrate different types of learning-strategies (cognitive, metacognitive and management strategies) instruction within gate-keeper math courses via presentation of course material, class discussions, assignments, and assessments. The theoretical model of this BPR project hypothesizes that the integration of learning-strategy instruction will have a direct effect on students' performance in gate-keeper math courses as well as an indirect effect through sparkling growth mindset and self-regulatory aptitude in the math classroom. It also hypothesizes a bidirectional relationship between math growth mindset and SRL, where the students' belief that they can improve (thinking in a math growth mindset framework) is needed for making adaptive adjustments to their learning processes (practicing SRL), and through SRL students recognize that they can improve their task performance which changes their math mindsets and makes them believe that they can learn at higher levels.
